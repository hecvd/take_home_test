How To Use:

##Console version:

No requirements needed, just run:
```
$ python main.py
```

## Web Version:

Install the requirements for the app with this command:

(Preferably using a virtualenv)

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run
```
$ python flask_server.py
```

This should start a flask server at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000) by default.
